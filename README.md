- 👋 Hi, I’m @SuperlativeBio
- 👀I am interested in how blockchain, AI, computer vision, and newer technologies are being applied in the pharmaceuticals space. I work on the manufacture of biological products, human cell & tissue-derived products, & small molecul
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on drug delivery, in vitro toxicology, telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, digital health, AI, ML, and healthcare blockchain projects: 
a) An exosome-based delivery system for the transport, delivery, and localization of therapeutic molecules within the skin tumor microenvironment to treat human skin cancer.
b) A HIPPA-compliant skin cancer patient blockchain whereby patient information is stored and organized in a cloud data lake, visualized on a mobile or fixed display, and analysed by AI. Using other tools within the blockchain, skin cancer patients can also set up smart contracts & receive payment for the use of their data from drug companies, research institutes, medical device companies, clinical trials organizers, insurance companies, etc. c) The development of a confocal virtual reality (VR) 3-dimensional (3-D) immersive system for the analyses of structural and spatial information, and cell and molecular signalling pathways operating within the tumor microenvironment of skin cancer patients. The view of the tissue can be manipulated to increase or decrease its magnification, adjust brightness & contrast, or to rotate the image to look at different parts of the tumor, using a portable headset, tactile controllers, LandingAI and Snowflake software, and a workstation. 
d) The development of an in vitro toxicology system that uses human umbilical cord- and placental- derived mesenchymal stem cells, and cell lineages that may be derived from these, to serve as a developmental toxicological tool to reduce the number of animals use in preclinical drug research.
